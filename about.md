I'm a Data Scientist and Research Mathematician interested in Machine Learning, Number Theory and Financial Mathematics 
from both theoretical and computational perspectives.  I have a passion for understanding and communicating interesting 
(often technical) concepts in plain language so anyone can understand the main idea of what's going on.


### More Information

Since May 2015 I've been working as a senior data scientist at Metis teaching a 12-week bootcamp helping amazing individuals 
become data scientists.  I also teach a freshman seminar at Princeton on 
["Secrecy, Search and Society"](https://www.princeton.edu/pub/frs/ay201516/fall-courses/index.xml#compfrs185) 
that explores how mathematical algorithms shape the social context of our modern society.

I've taught mathematics at Princeton, Rutgers, Duke, and the University of Georgia, and have held visiting research positions 
at several mathematics research institutes ([MSRI](http://www.msri.org), Max Planck Institute in Bonn).  I am also regularly 
involved with the [PROMYS summer program](http://www.promys.org) for high school students, based at Boston University, 
and serve on the Board of Trustees for the PROMYS Foundation.

My research in Number Theory has focused on the study of quadratic forms over the integers, and their symmetries.  I've 
proved the [290-Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_and_290_theorems) in collaboration with recent Fields Medalist 
M. Bharagava, written the Wikipedia page on [Stochastic Portfolio Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_portfolio_theory) 
(in collaboration with E. Robert Fernholz and I. Karatzas), and wrote the <tt>QuadraticForm</tt> class for the [SAGE](http://www.sagemath.org) 
open-source computer algebra system.  My papers are available online [here](http://papers.jonhanke.com).
